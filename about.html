            <p class="large_text">i.Fest is an idea conceptualized by IEEE Student Branch at DA-IICT. </p>
            <p class="large_text">Our main aim is to bring the budding engineers from all over India to a common platform so that they can share
                their knowledge with their fellow imaginers. The next big thing for engineers is to pull out graphics from
                computer or television screen and integrate them into real world environment. With these innovative engineers
                coming up, it will become more pervasive and ubiquitous.

        <div class="container text-center">
            <p class="large_text" style="padding-top: 110px"><br>Technology has grown appreciably in the last few years. From innovating new technologies to broadening the limits by sending robots where we can't go, humans have done it all! In this era of robots, a field like Animatronics finds its applications in various domains like films and television, advertising, toys, video games, and androids. Animatronics is essentially the art of creating the illusion of life via electronic devices. This industry has come a long way from its primitive roots and we are now getting closer to the era of human-like robots. So in the 21st century, where 'Humanizing Robots' is the prominent norm, we invite y'all to i.Fest 2018, Vivifying Automata.</p>
